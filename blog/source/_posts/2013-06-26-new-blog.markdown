I got bored of hosting on wordpress. I've moved over to an octopress
blog hosted as a static site on Amazon S3. I only pay for the bandwidth
used and no one reads this blog so it should be dirt cheap. 
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is a framework for technical blogging
based on the Jeckyll static site generator. I can write blog posts in
markdown and then deploy to s3 with a 
[rake task](http://www.jerome-bernard.com/blog/2011/08/20/quick-tip-for-easily-deploying-octopress-blog-on-amazon-s3/). 
Amazon S3 can be easily configured to [serve static web
sites](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html)
and I'm using Amazon Route 53 as the DNS server.
I wanted a blog up before gr8conf next month so that I can link to my
slides and example code. So far I'm happy with this set up, maybe it
will inspire me to blog more than 3 times a year.
