<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVT8Gw-7x_c">Growing Up with Grails from gr8conf US 2014</a></h1>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nVT8Gw-7x_c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Bloom Health was started in December 2009 and has been using grails and other groovy technology from day one. The team has grown to 30 developers, 4 devops and 10 testers. Our architecture has evolved from a single monolithic grails application to five smaller grails applications and a suite of dropwizard services behind them.

Over the last (nearly) five years we've learned a lot and grown up with the groovy ecosystem. I'll share what went well, what didn't and what choices I'd make if I was building a brand new company. If you're new to grails/groovy or are wondering if it could increase your team's productivity, then this is the talk for you!</p>

<p>As your team and software grows, its important to have a consistent development and testing environment for everyone. Vagrant is an open source tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments. Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework. At Bloom Health we use vagrant and chef and some custom internal tools to deploy everywhere from a developers laptop all the way through production. This includes 5 grails applications, 5 dropwizard services, mysql, redis and rabbitmq.

<p>I compare grails and dropwizard for building RESTful webservices, including their code readability, maintainability, deployment, metrics collection, scalability and testability.</p>
