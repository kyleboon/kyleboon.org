<h1>Favorite Books</h1>

I'm a lifelong reader and my favorite genres are science fiction and fantasy. I'm primarily a character-driven reader and I love books that have deep and well rounded characters whose motivations feel authentic. Also, magic.

<h3>Dune</h3>
<div class="book-author">by Frank Herbert</div>

I love science fiction that weaves some mysticism and/or religion into the story and Dune is my favorite book. I love the world building and that not everything is explained to the reader. Also Dune manages to do this in 187k words, which sometimes feels like the preface of modern science fiction.

<h3>Hyperion</h3>
<div class="book-author">by Dan Simmons</div>

Continuing the theme of religion and mysticism, Hyperion is a brilliant novel that brings together multiple stories each with their own characters and structure into a single story. I also love any story that has a Jesuit priest in it because I went to a Jesuit high school.

<h3>Lonesome Dove</h3>
<div class="book-author">by Larry McMurtry</div>

This book is the odd one out in this list. I don't read a lot of Westerns, but I love this book. The characters are incredible and Larry McMurtry writes slice-of-life better than any author I've read.

<h3>Fool's Errand</h3>
<div class="book-author">by Robin Hobb</div>

Robin Hobb is my favorite author and this is my favorite book from The Realm of the Elderlings series. Fitz, the main character of 3 of Hobb's series, will infuriate you, but you will love him anyway. And there is no plot armor for any characters in Robin Hobb's books.

<h3>The Shadow Rising</h3>
<div class="book-author">by Robert Jordan</div>
My favorite book from my favorite series. The main characters all start to evolve in their own unique ways and the plot and world building become much more complex and intricate.</div>
