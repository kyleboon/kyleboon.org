        I'm married to my wife Ann and have two daughters. We live in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In addition to being a
        husband, father and software engineer, I am a wooderworker, a cook, a bread baker and an avid reader of fantasy
        and science fiction novels. I <strike>often</strike> sometimes post about these on <a href="https://instagram.com/kyle.boon">Instagram</a>.
