    <p>
        I'm married to my wife Ann and have two daughters. We live in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In addition to being a
        husband, father and software engineer, I am a wooderworker, a cook, a bread baker and an avid reader of fantasy
        and science fiction novels (check out my <a href="/books">favorite books</a>). I sometimes post about these on <a href="https://instagram.com/kyle.boon">Instagram</a>.

    <p>
        I'm a Principal Software Engineer specializing in distributed systems and cloud architecture. I've built a wide variety of backend services over my twenty year career, including 
        customer master data management, supply chain, finance, and customer relationship management.

        My technical focus includes distributed systems, domain-driven design, and building resilient microservices architectures. 
        I'm particularly passionate about mentoring engineering teams and driving technical excellence through collaborative system design.

        I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio
        State University and have a healthy interest in the Buckeyes.
