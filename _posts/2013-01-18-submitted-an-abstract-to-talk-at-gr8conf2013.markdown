I submitted an abstract to speak at <a href="http://gr8conf.us/">gr8conf.us</a> this year in Minneapolis. This would my first time speaking at a conference.
<blockquote>A trend in web development has been towards microservices - or small, independent RESTful APIs that back a larger web application. For example, github's api allows you to do nearly anything that can be done on their website. There are several good options for building these services in groovy. In this talk we'll cover several options including grails, dropwizard and ratpack (or restlets, not sure which would better yet). We'll build the same service in all 3 frameworks and then compare the development experience, speed and memory footprint of all 3.</blockquote>
At BloomHealth we've been using <a title="DropWizard" href="https://www.dropwizard.io/en/stable/">DropWizard</a> for the last few weeks as we start to change to portions of our application into micro services.
