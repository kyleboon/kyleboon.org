# Website Changes

I'd like to start actively writing again even though I've only updated this site once in the last... seven years. In preparation for doing that, I made some changes to it.

* Switched hosting to GitHub pages. There was no reason for me to pay for anything on AWS to host this. It only cost about $2 a month, but I still don't want to pay it for no reason a month.
* Got rid of the existing theme I was using. I wrote my own CSS without using any framework or library. There's also no javascript. I want the site to be simple and fast.
* Deleting most of the old blog posts. They aren't relevant anymore.
